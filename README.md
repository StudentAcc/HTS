Hourglass Timesheet System<br>

A university team project to create an easy-to-use timesheet web application for the FDM Group so that their consultants could clock-in work hours and for managers to be able to view and assess the hours worked for accurate scheduling and wages. My primary responsibility was to create the front-end and back-end logic for the forms and timesheets views for the consultants and managers.
